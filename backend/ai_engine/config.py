"""Illustrative ordinal profiles, NOT hardware benchmarks or latency predictions.

Team definitions (agree with teammates):
- on_device: inference executes on the user's own hardware.
- far_edge: nearby far-edge/access-network compute, generally closest network hop.
- regional_edge: regional data center, generally farther than far edge.
- cloud: centralized, elastic cloud infrastructure.

All 0-100 values encode transparent demo assumptions, NOT measurements.
