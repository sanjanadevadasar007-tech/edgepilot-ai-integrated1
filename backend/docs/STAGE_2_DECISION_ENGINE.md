# EdgePilot Person 2 — Stage 2: constraint-aware scoring

Stage 2 replaces **five Python source files** while keeping Stage 1 benchmark matching, the Qualcomm adapter, the CLI, and the team request/response contract intact.

## What the patch changes

- `ai_engine/validation.py`: additional strictly validated optional workload fields.
- `ai_engine/metrics.py`: validates tier-specific residency and availability evidence.
- `ai_engine/feasibility.py`: deterministic hard constraints plus a separate list of unknown checks.
- `ai_engine/scoring.py`: transparent weighted decision scoring, with per-factor origins and contribution analysis.
- `ai_engine/recommender.py`: preserves v1 response keys and adds `details.weights`, `details.evidence_gaps`, `details.decision_drivers`, `details.explanation_source`.
- `tests/test_stage2_decision.py`: 20 offline tests covering the changes.

The formula is `score(tier) = sum(weight_i * score_i(tier)) / sum(weight_i)` for eligible tiers, and zero for excluded tiers. Scores are *heuristic suitability indices* (not calibrated probabilities or benchmarks). All criterion profiles are project assumptions and require validation. Tier order in ties is stable.

### Handling unknown values

If **no cost** is supplied for a tier, affordability gets 50/100 (neutral prior) with `origin: unknown_neutral_prior`, *not* an actual predicted cost. No money value is returned in `estimates.monthly_cost`. The default neutral score still influences the ranking; the associated uncertainty is explicit in the response. Stage 3 will improve comparability by providing sourced per-tier estimates.

`latency_ms` in tier metrics means **end-to-end** latency under a comparable workload. `inference_latency_ms` means only time spent running the model and does not change end-to-end score. An E2E *measured* latency beyond deadline is a hard gate. An *estimated* latency beyond deadline is a soft scoring penalty. `quoted` monthly cost beyond budget is gated; `estimated` cost is a preference penalty. Quotes and measurements must be genuine and accurately identified by the integration layer.

### Hard feasibility rules

1. Explicit `allowed_tiers` policy.
2. `require_offline` or `allow_remote_processing: false` excludes remote tiers.
3. `network_available: false` or zero available bandwidth excludes remote tiers.
4. Confirmed insufficient available network bandwidth excludes remote tiers.
5. Confirmed on-device memory shortage excludes the device tier.
6. Evidenced incompatible model/hardware blocks its tier.
7. Measured E2E latency misses a mandatory deadline.
8. Quoted cost exceeds monthly budget.
9. Evidenced data residency mismatch / compliance failure excludes the affected tier.
10. Measured availability falls below explicit `minimum_availability_percent`.

Any unverified requirement stays **unknown**, not automatically feasible or infeasible. `details.feasibility[tier].eligible` means not ruled out; `details.evidence_gaps[tier]` lists missing evidence. Policy/compliance statements are assumed to be properly sourced from trusted data supplied by Person 3; Stage 2 cannot independently certify compliance.

### New optional request fields

| Field | Example | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `application_type` | `smart_camera` | Workload label only (not a verified capability) |
| `model_name` | `mobilenet_v2` | Stage 1 benchmark selector |
| `target_device` | `Samsung Galaxy S25 (Family)` | Stage 1 benchmark selector |
| `runtime` | `tflite` | Stage 1 benchmark selector |
| `precision` | `float` | Stage 1 benchmark selector |
| `allowed_data_regions` | `["IN"]` | Explicit policy: regions where processing is allowed |
| `minimum_availability_percent` | `99.9` | Explicit hard availability threshold, gated by measured availability |

Existing optional fields from Stage 1 remain supported, including RAM, offline/network, allowed tiers, concurrency.

### New optional metrics_by_tier fields

Person 3 may pass these only when supported by a provider, deployment config, or validated monitoring:

```python
{
 "cloud": {
   "source": "quoted", "deployment_region": "IN",
   "data_residency_compliant": True, "monthly_cost_inr": 900,
   "source_note": "Provider quote ID and date"
 },
 "on_device": {
   "source": "measured", "model_compatible": True,
   "availability_percent": 99.95,
   "source_note": "Recorded conditions/date and method"
 }
}
```

Do not invent or present the above EXAMPLE numbers as measurements or actual quotes. `source: demo` records are ignored by the engine. The single source on a tier record applies to its fields; **do not mix cost quotes with unrelated inference measurements**. Stage 3 will introduce a cleaner per-metric source contract.

### API output added in `details`

- `weights`: actual algorithm weights based on workload.
- `score_breakdown.{tier}.{factor}.origin`: `heuristic_profile`, `unknown_neutral_prior`, `measured_end_to_end_latency`, `estimated_monthly_cost`, etc.
- `score_breakdown.{tier}.{factor}.weighted_contribution`: contribution in 0–100 score points.
- `evidence_gaps.{tier}`: mandatory verification missing for the tier, not an exclusion.
- `feasibility.{tier}.verification`: `partial` or `checked` (NOT regulatory compliance certification).
- `decision_drivers`: advantages over runner-up, by factor; interpret negative values as disadvantages.
- `explanation_source`: `deterministic` or `qualcomm_llm` (only indicates a successful adapter return; not that explanation accuracy is certified).
- `method`: `transparent_weighted_heuristic_v2`.

**Old keys** `recommended_tier`, `scores`, `estimates`, `explanation`, `tradeoffs`, `warnings`, `assumptions`, `architecture` stay unchanged. Stage 1 `details.benchmark` is preserved by `recommend_with_benchmarks()`.

## Install (macOS, from existing project directory)

Make sure you're in `~/Desktop/edgepilot_person2_handoff` and your `.venv` is active. Back up changed files before extracting the patch:

```bash
mkdir -p backup_stage2/ai_engine
cp ai_engine/{validation,metrics,feasibility,scoring,recommender}.py backup_stage2/ai_engine/
# After downloading and examining the ZIP contents:
unzip -o ~/Downloads/edgepilot_stage2_decision_engine_patch.zip -d .
```

To verify:

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
python3 -m ai_engine.benchmark_cli --input examples/request_s25_match.json --benchmark-dir benchmarks > /tmp/edgepilot_stage2.json
python3 - <<'PY'
import json
r=json.load(open('/tmp/edgepilot_stage2.json'))
print('Recommended:', r['recommended_tier'])
print('Method:', r['details']['method'])
print('Benchmark:', r['details']['benchmark']['status'])
print('Drivers:', r['details']['decision_drivers'][:3])
print('Cost origin:', r['details']['score_breakdown']['on_device']['affordability']['origin'])
print('Missing evidence:', r['details']['evidence_gaps'][r['recommended_tier']])
PY
```

These tests don't require an internet connection or the Qualcomm API key. To smoke-test real LLM after verifying certificate trust and loading your environment variables:

```bash
set -a; source .env; set +a
python3 -m ai_engine.benchmark_cli --input examples/request_s25_match.json --benchmark-dir benchmarks --qualcomm
```

If the LLM fails, the deterministic explanation remains available; inspect `details.explanation_source`.

## Ownership

- Person 2: decision algorithms, rules, benchmark matching, evidence quality, unit tests.
- Person 3: actual per-tier cost and end-to-end latency measurements/estimates with sources; API/routes, persistence and simulation routing.
- Person 1: display infeasible tiers separately from `0/100`, show `null` estimates as *Unknown*, warnings and evidence gaps.

## Next Stage 3

Build a field-specific evidence contract so each metric (`latency_ms`, `monthly_cost_inr`, privacy/residency, model compatibility) can have its own independent provenance, quality and measurement configuration; connect cost / network models from Person 3. Run against comparable workloads; otherwise avoid claiming verified tier superiority.
